<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

TODO:

## Overview
 
Another confused, frustrating effort to achieve something that seemed so simple; yet I do not feel like I was shown how to accomplish this at all.  I studied the weeks notes, rewatched videos, thought the Todo app was the clue, but came to realise it had very little to do with what was being asked. Compounded by Jquery made it ridiculous. 

Sadly I will be submitting what I have, currently incomplete and not fully working at all.  I will have to re-submit this to improve my grade once the logic has been achieved.

I felt like a lot of what we were shown in class this week didn't help me.  

It's like in Maths class, the teacher will show you some examples of similar things, re going over it to instill the knowledge, the answers are actually explained somewhere - Maths is Maths, code is code.  

With this I felt like after a brief (extremely basic) encounter with Javascript, we were immediately thrown onto Jquery - a depreciated, 'browser wars' API that if we really needed to learn (for older site maintenance) I could learn it then, possibly.  I feel like I'd sooner turn the job down or rewrite the entire site in vanilla JS in fairness.

## Overview: MID-COURSE RANT: (*warning!*)
#
This course needs to teach me how to be an amazing front-end developer, to THINK LIKE AN ACTUAL PROGRAMMER, I need to be fluent in Javascript and CSS - I fail to see why the material from the last 3 weeks have even been added to this bootcamp.

The student is only as good as the material they receive.  I am not taking responsibility for failing this assignment.

You know what I should be an expert on be now (aside from CSS and JS? Setting and switching fontawesome ICONS!! See my mess within.

Very disappointed, once again and it's been a total bust this last fortnight.

<!-- the product -->

## The Product

Product screenshot:

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/Matt-Jones-Developer/plan_up-daily_planner)

## Criteria

The app should:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page

#

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This project has a single html page, with a main.js file.  The app will run in your browser.
When you enter a 9AM appointment, it will save to localStorage.  Upon refresh it will be retrieved from localStorage.  The Light/Dark mode almost done, some poor styling done, but if I am having to spend 20 hours trying to figure out why I don't understand what's being asked, that's the best I can do.

I have yet to get this app finished and will resubmit. 

#
### Prerequisites

N/A

#

### Installation

No installation required.  Just load your browser.
